There are several Agile frameworks that organizations and development teams can adopt to implement Agile methodologies. Each framework has its own set of practices, roles, and ceremonies designed to promote collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development. Here are some of the most widely used Agile frameworks:

1. **Scrum:**
   Scrum is one of the most popular Agile frameworks. It organizes work into time-boxed iterations called sprints, usually lasting 2-4 weeks. Scrum teams have predefined roles including a Scrum Master (facilitator), Product Owner (represents customer needs), and Development Team. Scrum includes ceremonies like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

2. **Kanban:**
   Kanban is focused on visualizing and optimizing the flow of work. It doesn't have fixed iterations like Scrum but uses a continuous flow model. Work items are represented on a Kanban board, progressing through different stages of development. The emphasis is on limiting work in progress (WIP) and optimizing the efficiency of the workflow.

3. **Extreme Programming (XP):**
   Extreme Programming emphasizes technical excellence and close collaboration between developers and customers. It includes practices like pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration, and frequent releases. XP aims to deliver high-quality software through short development cycles.

4. **Lean Agile:**
   Lean Agile combines principles from Lean thinking and Agile methodologies. It focuses on reducing waste, optimizing efficiency, and delivering value to customers. It emphasizes continuous improvement, feedback loops, and adapting to changing requirements.

5. **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM):**
   DSDM is an Agile framework that provides a structured approach to project delivery. It includes principles like incremental development, time-boxing, and collaboration between business and development teams. DSDM provides guidance on roles, artifacts, and ceremonies.

6. **Feature-Driven Development (FDD):**
   FDD is an Agile framework that organizes development around features. It involves creating a high-level model of the system, identifying features, and then iterating on those features using short cycles. FDD emphasizes design, domain modeling, and frequent releases.

7. **Crystal:**
   Crystal is a family of Agile methodologies with different versions (Crystal Clear, Crystal Yellow, Crystal Orange, etc.) tailored for different project sizes and team dynamics. Crystal emphasizes communication, frequent delivery, and adapting to the needs of the project.

8. **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework):**
   SAFe is designed to scale Agile practices across large organizations. It provides a structured approach for coordinating work across multiple Agile teams, ensuring alignment with business goals. SAFe includes roles, ceremonies, and artifacts for both team-level and portfolio-level planning and execution.

9. **Nexus:**
   Nexus is a framework for scaling Scrum to large and complex projects. It provides additional guidance on how to coordinate the work of multiple Scrum teams while maintaining the core principles of Scrum.

10. **Less (Large Scale Scrum):**
    Less is another framework for scaling Scrum to larger organizations. It emphasizes simplicity and provides guidelines for scaling Scrum while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

When choosing an Agile framework, consider your team's size, structure, culture, and the nature of the projects you work on. Some organizations may even combine elements from different frameworks to create a customized Agile approach that suits their specific needs.
