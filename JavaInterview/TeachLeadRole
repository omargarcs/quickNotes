The role of a Tech Lead in software development is multifaceted, combining technical expertise with leadership and communication skills. Here are some key activities that a Tech Lead typically engages in during the development process:

1. **Technical Guidance**: A Tech Lead provides technical direction, helps the team make architecture and design decisions, and ensures that the chosen technologies and solutions align with the project's goals.

2. **Code Review**: Reviewing code written by team members for quality, adherence to coding standards, and best practices is a crucial responsibility. This helps maintain a high level of code quality and consistency across the project.

3. **Mentoring**: Guiding and mentoring junior developers is an essential aspect of the Tech Lead role. This includes helping them solve complex problems, offering guidance on best practices, and assisting in their professional growth.

4. **Problem Solving**: Tech Leads often need to address technical challenges and roadblocks that the development team encounters. They're responsible for finding solutions, troubleshooting issues, and making decisions that keep the project on track.

5. **Collaboration**: Tech Leads collaborate with other teams, such as product managers, designers, and QA engineers, to ensure a smooth development process. Effective communication and coordination are critical for project success.

6. **Architecture and Design**: The Tech Lead contributes to the project's architecture and design decisions, ensuring that the system is scalable, maintainable, and aligned with the overall technical vision.

7. **Estimations and Planning**: Tech Leads often play a role in estimating the time and effort required for development tasks. They contribute to project planning, ensuring that the team has a realistic understanding of what can be achieved within given timeframes.

8. **Technical Debt Management**: Identifying and managing technical debt is important for maintaining a healthy codebase. Tech Leads work with the team to prioritize refactoring and improving existing code when necessary.

9. **Performance and Optimization**: Tech Leads may be involved in performance analysis and optimization efforts, ensuring that the application meets performance requirements and optimizing critical parts of the system.

10. **Continuous Learning**: Staying updated with industry trends, new technologies, and best practices is essential for a Tech Lead. They should encourage a culture of continuous learning within the team as well.

11. **Conflict Resolution**: Addressing conflicts within the team or between team members is part of the leadership role. This includes resolving disagreements, promoting a positive work environment, and fostering collaboration.

12. **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating technical risks in the project is crucial. Tech Leads should be proactive in anticipating potential issues and taking steps to minimize their impact.

Remember that the exact activities can vary based on the organization, project size, and specific development methodologies in use (e.g., Agile, Waterfall). The Tech Lead's role is dynamic, and they often need to adapt to the evolving needs of the project and the team.
